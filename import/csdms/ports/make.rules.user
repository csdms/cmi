# This is an empty stub for the user to add extra targets
# to the ports/Makefile build.
# The following targets are reserved to bocca:
#	 all, check_top_dir, check, clean, distclean, install, install_local, install-all,
#    debug, .gencode, .msg, .PHONY

# All user defined variables should be prefixed with something project
# related. We will dispatch to the following user-defined targets.

# The user may extend our set of phony targets by defining USER_PHONY in make.vars.user

# before our build
pre-build-user:
	$(dprint) "Build hook $@ in $(MYDIR) started"
	$(dprint) "Build hook $@ in $(MYDIR) completed"

# in the predefined makefile to ensure proper dependency handling)
