# This is an empty stub for the user to add extra targets
# to the components/Makefile build.
# The following targets are reserved to bocca:
#	 all, check_top_dir, check, clean, distclean, install, install_local, install-all,
#    debug, .gencode, .msg, .PHONY

# All user defined variables should be prefixed with something project
# related. We will dispatch to the following user-defined targets:
# pre-build-user, post-build-user, install-user, check-user, clean-user, and distclean-user

# before our build
pre-build-user:
	$(dprint) "Build hook $@ in $(MYDIR) started"
	$(dprint) "Build hook $@ in $(MYDIR) completed"

# after our build (note the necessary :: for this rule since it's also defined 
# in components/Makefile to ensure proper dependency handling)
post-build-user::
	$(dprint) "Build hook $@ in $(MYDIR) started"
	$(dprint) "Build hook $@ in $(MYDIR) completed"

# before our install
pre-install-user:
	$(dprint) "Build hook $@ in $(MYDIR) started"
	$(dprint) "Build hook $@ in $(MYDIR) completed"

# after our install 
post-install-user:
	$(dprint) "Build hook $@ in $(MYDIR) started"
	$(dprint) "Build hook $@ in $(MYDIR) completed"

# after our check
check-user:
	$(dprint) "Build hook $@ in $(MYDIR) started"
	$(dprint) "Build hook $@ in $(MYDIR) completed"

# after our clean
clean-user:
	$(dprint) "Build hook $@ in $(MYDIR) started"
	$(dprint) "Build hook $@ in $(MYDIR) completed"

# after our distclean
distclean-user:
	$(dprint) "Build hook $@ in $(MYDIR) started"
	$(dprint) "Build hook $@ in $(MYDIR) completed"
